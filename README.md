## My process

As my first project with Angular, my goal was to understand and practice the basic concepts. (Components, interpolation, directives...) I really enjoyed working with the "angular cli", in addition to making the work easier, it helps a lot when applying patterns to the project.

### Built with

- [Angular](https://angular.dev/) - Angular Framework
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets

### Continued development

Continue learning about the framework and working on more complex projects. In the future, I want to build a full-stack application together with NestJs.
